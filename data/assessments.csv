Material expansion: In relation to Thermal Coal Power, production refers to an investment to (i) extend the unabated operating lifetime of existing thermal coal power plants including captives or (ii) increase net operational thermal power capacity, including captives, by more than 10% measure from a baseline of maximum capacity for preceding 3 years reported. Material expansion in such cases relates to absolute global increases rather than increases for an entity or Group as a result of mergers or acquisitions.

Project finance is defined as the financing of the construction of, and normally the subsequent operation of, large energy, infrastructure and production facilities projects. Project finance is a long-term structured funding arrangement in which debt repayment is primarily reliant on the project’s cash flows upon completion, with no or limited recourse to the project’s shareholders.
Regarding value chain coverage, the restrictions on coal and peat apply to utility companies. For coal specifically, the restrictions also apply to extraction by metals and mining companies.

Fossil fuels are defined as a class of hydrocarbon containing materials of biological origin occurring within the Earth’s crust that can be used as a source of energy, including coal, petroleum, natural gas, oil shales, peat, tar sands and heavy oils.
