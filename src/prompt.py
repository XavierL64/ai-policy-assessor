STEPS = f"""
Follow these steps:

1. Determine commitment
- If the policy includes a clear commitment for the criteria, set `"commitment": true`; otherwise, false.
	
2. Assess exceptions
- If `"commitment"` is true, evaluate every exception in the taxonomy.
- For each exception, return:
	○ "exception_id": ID from the taxonomy.  
	○ "applies": true if the exception applies, otherwise false.  
	○ "description": short description ≤ {DESCRIPTION_LENGTH} words if applies, else null.
	○ "mitigated": true if a mitigant clearly applies, else false.  
	○ "mitigant": short description ≤ {DESCRIPTION_LENGTH} words if mitigated, else null. 
- If `"commitment"` is false, return `"exceptions": []`.
"""

RULES = """
Strict rules:
- Include all exceptions from the taxonomy, even if they do not apply.  
- Never invent IDs, exceptions, or mitigants not in the taxonomy.  
- Never infer commitments, exceptions, or mitigants not explicitly supported by the policy extract.  
- Output valid JSON strictly following the function schema.  
- Return only the JSON object. Do not include any other text.
- For borderline cases, only mark as true if explicit evidence exists.
